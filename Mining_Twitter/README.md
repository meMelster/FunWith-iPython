###Mining Twitter

The code below gets the Twitter trends for 5 locations of interest today, by using the countries WOEID. 
I used a modified version of pygmaps, available under Issue 5 at https://code.google.com/p/pygmaps/. This modified version enables the use of labels for the maps pinpoints. 
When the user hovers over the pinpoint I display the top 5 trending topics on Twitter for the area indicated by th pin point on the map.


UPDATE: If you are having issues running this code, it may be because of your version of iPython. 
If this is the case, the github url should be appended to nbviewer.ipython.org/urls ie - http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/github/meMelster/FunWith-iPython/blob/master/Mining_Twitter/Serrano_Homework2_Twitter.ipynb
